# cravePOS
### React-based Point-of-sale Web App

#### Overview

When connected to the local instance of [craveDB](https://github.com/brad-nst/craveDB-electron), users are authenticated with a pin code referenced against user entries in the database. After auth is handled, users can tab through venue sections to view active tables, add new tables or, if they have manager-level permissions, modify venue layouts.
